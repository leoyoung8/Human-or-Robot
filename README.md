# Human-or-Robot
this is Facebook Recruiting IV on kaggle. I achieved 93% accuracy, just 1.2% lower than the winner. 
The objective is to identify robots that bids in online bidding, and it's similar to a fraud detection problem. 
I used Logistic Regression, SVM, PCA, Random Forest, Neural Network, and K-fold cross-validation.
